/* Action items:
 1. Make a text file with all of the colors you want,
   in order of the 5 colors that will appear on screen.
   In JS, you'll slice by every 5 colors and assign them to arrays.
 2. Write a function where clicking on space will take a new array of colors
   and assign them to each panel.
